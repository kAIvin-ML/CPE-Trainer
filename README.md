<!-- Introduction -->
## Introduction

The Proficiency Trainer allows anyone to refresh and deepen their English skills for free, flexibly and tailored to Cambridge standards. Users can understand text complexity through statistics and then work on these texts with fill-in-the-blank exercises. Thanks to GenAI, targeted exercises can be created for problem words or phrases. Optionally, Machine Learning can be used to identify difficult vocabulary or gaps in concentration within learning behavior.
