This was invitation enough. Bingley. Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before one Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week. What will his name be? Bingley. Is he married or single? Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!
